Drawing Program
<p>This is one of my third year university projects. You can download a demo <a href="Resources/ProjectFiles/AdvancedSoftwareEngineering/Advanced%20Software%20Engineering.exe">here</a>. Simply run the executable. It should run under Wine, but I experienced problems with the file locator. The open source repository is <a href="https://github.com/c3ypt1c/Advanced-Software-Engineering-Drawing-Project">here</a>.</p>

<h5>The language</h5>
<p>It is a simple drawing program that uses a programming language designed for this project. I was told to instructed to create a program to meet a <a href=Resources/ProjectFiles/AdvancedSoftwareEngineering/L6ASE2020assignmentSpec.pdf>specific set of guidelines</a>. I achieved 100% of the available marks in this project, meeting all of the criteria necessary. The program can let you draw anything that you might like.</p>

<p>Some of the requirements were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Drawing of basic shapes and lines, like circles and squares.</li>
    <li>The ability to store and retrieve variables.</li>
    <li>Flow control, more specifically, <code>if</code> statements.</li>
    <li>Methods and functions. Specifically functions with or without parameters (recursions was not required).</li>
    <li>Loading and unloading programs.</li>
    <li>Error detection.</li>
</ul>

<p>I go over these and my code in two videos. I don't recommend watching them because they are really long and might be really boring. It was requirement for the project. They're here:<p>

<div class="preview mx-auto"><img class="mx-auto d-block" id="img" src="Resources/ProjectFiles/AdvancedSoftwareEngineering/Hue.png"></div>

<script>
    function updateTo(src) {
        document.getElementById("img").src = src.src;
    }
</script>

<h5>Documentation</h5>
<p>It was required that the software engineering project is fully documented. Every class has documentation regarding its use and place in the program. The documentation was generated <a href="https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen">Doxygen</a>. You can read the documentation <a href="Resources/ProjectFiles/AdvancedSoftwareEngineering/html/annotated.html">here</a>.</p>
