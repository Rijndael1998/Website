Password Manager

<p>For my final year of university, I had to develop a security related product. The task of developing a product came with project management and everything that comes with that, including risk arrestment, resource allocation, development methodology, etc. </p>

<h5 class="mt-2">Features</h5>
<ul>
    <li>You can choose your own encryption: AES or Blowfish ciphers with PBKDF2 or Argon2 key derivation functions</li>
    <li>Strongest security that adapts to your hardware and patience:
        <ul>
            <li>The program adapts the number of rounds to the time needed to unlock based on a benchmark</li>
            <li>The program can adapt to the amount of RAM available (Argon2 specific)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Separate identities are available</li>
    <li>Shared recovery method</li>
    <li>Paper recovery method</li>
    <li>Password Generator</li>
    <li>Theming Support</li>
</ul>

<h5>Encryption and Data Security</h5>
<p>The encryption included in this password manager is top notch, and I personally consider it "military grade" or better. The reason being is that this software solution doesn't leak any data, it uses the same algorithms that the military uses. It also uses new and improved algorithms such as Argon2 and Blowfish over old algorithms like AES and PBKDF2 if the user decides to.</p>

<p>It is not unreasonable to assume any adversary that attempts to decrypt the password manager’s encryption might not be willing to allow the user to walk away free, or worse - <!--comment: This made the examiner chuckle, and it is funny if you're not under constant threats and see "torture" as trying to remember your password... But, in the correct context, it's 100% serious... The CIA have in the past interrogated people and the Soviets did too. The methods they used (or still do) are horrible, to say the least. If I ever add popups to this website, this will be one of the popups.-->the adversary may cause the user to expire in a painful way; or - the user may want to terminate themselves given the alternative of torture<!--/comment-->. Due to this, this password manager allows the user to distribute a shared recovery scheme before being interrogated that allows other people to unlock and read the contents of the password manager. There is no way to tell how many shared recovery schemes have been made and if done correctly, this also means that any adversary would also not know who the pieces have been distributed to. A shared recovery scheme is a scheme where the user creates a number of pieces and an opening threshold where a secret (like a master key) can be derived. Both the threshold and pieces of the scheme can be set independently of each other. (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.857/OldStuff/Fall03/ref/Shamir-HowToShareASecret.pdf">Adi Shamir</a>, 1979). Alternatively, another backup method exists that does not use the shared recovery scheme if the user trusts a sole entity or wants to back up the master key and keep it in a very secure place. </p>

<h5>Identities</h5>

<p>Another distinct feature of the password manager is that it implements “Identities”, which are fundamentally a collection of accounts. The password manager is designed as a supplement for operating on the Tor network. Having identities ensures that the user does not accidentally “link”, accounts that they do not want to be linked together, allowing the user to assume an identity per Tor session. This allows for a much safer operating security when doing sensitive tasks.</p>
