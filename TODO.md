### To do:
 - Generation:
   - Complete down.html
     - Pack CSS images into file for `down.html` automatically.
     - JavaScript LZMA compression. See: https://github.com/LZMA-JS/LZMA-JS
 - Misc:
   - Write about the program in the wiki
   - Add fonts, specifically Gravity.
   - Fix bad integrity checks
   - Embedding images should be better
   - Embed latest `green_line.svg` file.
 - Bugs:
   - Content floats up sometimes. Need clock or something. Definitely need a better way to control the animations other than just disabling them in mobile or just letting css handle everything.
