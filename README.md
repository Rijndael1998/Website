# Website
This is my website generation tool that I use on my website. There are still a lot of things to do. Thanks for checking out my repo.

#### TODO
- Complete down.html
  - Pack CSS images into file for DOWN automatically.
  - JavaScript compression. 
- Create content for the page
- Make the page responsive
- Fix:  character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol.
